# Dot Matrix

A WIP C++ Game Boy emulator. The CPU is complete now but still needs work to pass Blargs test suite. Parts of memory handling and interrupts are also done. Putting this project on hold before tackling the PPU. 

## Dependencies

I used vcpkg but this project should work with an alternate package manager/linking the external libraries directly.

```
SDL2
fmt
